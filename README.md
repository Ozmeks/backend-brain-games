"Brain Games" - a set of five console games, built on the principle of popular mobile applications for pumping the brain. Each game asks questions that need to be answered correctly. After three correct answers, it is believed that the game is passed. Wrong answers complete the game and offer to pass it again. Games:
* Calculator. Arithmetic expressions to be evaluated.
* Progression. Search for missing numbers in a sequence of numbers.
* Determination of an even number.
* Determination of the greatest common factor.
* Definition of a prime number.
